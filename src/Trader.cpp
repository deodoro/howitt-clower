 NOTE: Check this algorithm. ChatGPT says:
 Checking fr >= r is wrong: it skips any trader with id >= r (not just self) and can bias selection.
 The current index math (k+1) can go out of range when k is the last index.
 Simpler, correct approach: pick a random index in the full vector; if it equals r and size>1, pick the next (or wrap) â€” this guarantees a different trader without bias and avoids bounds errors.
